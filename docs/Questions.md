##  **Introduction**

The learn page of each topic has a very interactive Question and Answer section which provides awareness about:

-   Common questions related to the topic are answered.
-   References to articles are provided for more clarity and confirmation of facts.

This is how the Question/Answer section looks on the website:

2.  **Question priority** : This defines the placement of the Question placard on the website. Only numbers can be entered here. When a new question with a required priority is added, the priority for all questions needs to be altered.

    Solution for this is - add priority in the differentials of 20 each. This gives enough scope for adding questions before or after the existing questions.

    **Things to keep in mind**

    -   Only one connection out of Articles and Elements can be active at a time.
